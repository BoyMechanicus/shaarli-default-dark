# shaarli-default-dark
a dark version of shaarli's default theme

do you like dark reader's theme and want users of your shaarli to have the same
experience without needing the extention? well this theme is for you

## installation
- install and configure [shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/shaarli)
- git clone this into <shaarli webroot>`/tpl/`
- go in the shaarli panel and change the theme to this

## note
i only changed the css of the theme to make it dark, so the only difference is in `css/` if your version
of shaarli is newer than mine (shaarli 0.10.x) consider instead taking the newest default theme and replacing `tpl/<theme>/css/`
with this css
